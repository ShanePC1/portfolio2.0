Issues to address logo does not appear on sub routes? sub domains /grid/++ anything here
	Some images are showoing a scroll bar under them. Everything should be full size if the image cuts off text the image should shrink giving room for the text.
I dont really liek the current next buttons they should really just be the whole right or left of screen
I'd like to do two things one move the photo arrays out of the routes file. Two I'd like each routes photo array to populate off of the main array based on the description using includes or simmilar

Once those are fixed created a partial for purchase print whihc will apply to every image
Will need to create all the check out logic
Once that is done create a merch store.
